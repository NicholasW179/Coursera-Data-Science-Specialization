This section contains the files for the third course getting and cleaning data. the codebook is as follows:

This code in run_analysis.r downloads the files from the internet, then uses regular expressions to pull the means and standard deviations.
Then it pulls out the features wanted, and combines them into both training and test data. Finally it merges the files into a combined data set.


tactivities: the activities in the training set
tsubjects: the subject numbers in the training set
train: initially the measurements, later combined with both tsubjects and tactivities 

test_activity: the activities in the test set
test_subject: the subject numbers in the test set
test: combined measurements with activities and subject numbers

combined: the full combination of train and test sets
